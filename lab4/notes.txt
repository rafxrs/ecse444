BSP functions like stm32l4s5i_iot01_hsensor.h must be included in main.c

Choose one thing to measure using each of the following: HTS221, LIS3MDL, LSM6DSL, and
LPS22HB
The code generation process does not initialize the peripherals. Do so by calling the appropriate
initialization functions (e.g., BSP_HSENSOR_Init()) in main.c

write code to read each sensor value (four of them) at 10 H
